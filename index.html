                <h2>Nikolas Tesla</h2>
                <p>Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the production,
                    transmission and application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor
                    and developed AC generation and transmission technology.</p>

                <p>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed
                    the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics) His
                    work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public
                    for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"</p>

                <h2>Alexander Graham Bell</h2>
                <p>Alexander Graham Bell is most well known for inventing the telephone. He came to the U.S as a teacher
                    of the deaf, and conceived the idea of "electronic speech" while visiting his hearing-impaired mother
                    in Canada. This led him to invent the microphone and later the "electrical speech machine" -- his name
                    for the first telephone.</p>

                    17th-century scientific revolution. He is best known for his laws of planetary motion, based on his works
                    Astronomia nova, Harmonices Mundi, and Epitome of Copernican Astronomy.</p>
